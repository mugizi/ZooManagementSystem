ZooManagementSystem is a Java project that simulates a virtual zoo environment. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, specifically polymorphism and inheritance. It features a Zoo2 class with a main method, which creates an array of Animal objects representing various animals found in a zoo, such as lions, elephants, and monkeys. Each animal class (Lion, Elephant, Monkey) extends the Animal superclass and provides implementations for methods like makeSound and eat.

The main method iterates through the array of animals, printing the name of each animal followed by its specific behaviors, such as making sounds and eating habits. This project showcases the flexibility and extensibility of object-oriented design, allowing for easy addition of new animal types and behaviors by simply creating new subclasses of Animal with appropriate implementations.

**Key Features:**

Demonstrates polymorphism and inheritance in Java.
Simulates a virtual zoo environment with various animal types.
Provides a structured output displaying each animal's name and specific behaviors.
Easy to extend with new animal types and behaviors.

**Usage:**

Compile the Java files (Zoo.java, Animal.java, Lion.java, Elephant.java, Monkey.java).
Run the Zoo class.
Observe the output to see the virtual zoo environment in action, with each animal displaying its characteristic behaviors.
